"""Apple App Store data sources.

Three endpoints do the work, all keyless:

* the legacy iTunes RSS chart feed, which is the only Apple source that still
  filters a top-100 chart down to a single game subgenre (e.g. Puzzle);
* the iTunes Search API, swept across several terms to discover new releases,
  because the RSS "newapplications" feed ignores its genre parameter;
* the iTunes Lookup API, which enriches ids with ratings and release dates.
